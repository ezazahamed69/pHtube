    Discuss the scope of var, let, and const?</li>
    
        <p class="font-light ml-20">The var keyword is a legacy keyword that was introduced in JavaScript 1.0. It   has global or function scope, and can be updated and re-declared.

        The let keyword was introduced in JavaScript ES6. It has block scope, and can be updated but not re-declared.
        The const keyword was also introduced in JavaScript ES6. It has block scope, and cannot be updated or re-declared.
         </p>
        <li class="font-bold pb-6 mt-10 ml-20 underline">
        Tell us the use cases of null and undefined. </li>
        <p class="font-light ml-20">
            Null is used to represent the intentional absence of a value. For example, you might use null to represent a missing value in a database.
            Undefined is used to represent the unintentional absence of a value. For example, a variable might be undefined if it has not been assigned a value yet.</p>
        <li class="font-bold pb-6 mt-10 ml-20 underline">What do you mean by REST API?</li>
        <p class="font-light ml-20">REST API stands for Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface. It is an architectural style for designing APIs that uses HTTP requests to access and manipulate resources. REST APIs are widely used to connect different applications and systems, and they are a fundamental building block of the modern web.</p>
